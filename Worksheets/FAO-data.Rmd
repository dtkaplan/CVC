Food and Agriculture Organization Data
======================

```{r include=FALSE}
require(DCF)
```

The `FAOsimple` dataset provides a quick introduction to "big" data.  The structure of the data set is very simple:
* Cases are countries
* Variables relate to different measures of land use and population size. 

### Starting with Graphics

We use it as a starting point for making graphics, particularly scatter plots.

### Reading in the Data

As part of the `DCF` package, it's easy to read in the data.
```{r}
data(FAOsimple)
```
There are 224 cases, which turn out to be countries.
```{r}
nrow(FAOsimple)
```
There are 52 variables, of which a few are listed here --- the complete list is below:
```{r}
head(names(FAOsimple))
```

The countries are:
```{r}
with(FAOsimple, Country)
```
## FAO Variable Names

```{r}
names(FAOsimple)
```
