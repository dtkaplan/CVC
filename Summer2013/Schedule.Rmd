--------------------------

### Wednesday, June 12, 2013

**Noon-1:00** Opening lunch at Prince Conference Center, Introductions

*Sessions will take place in Science Building 128, refreshments will be in the adjoining 
Reading Room.*

**1:15-3:15** Session 1, Data and Display Travelogue.

Our colleagues from Macalester will take us on a highlight tour of the types of data sets
and graphical display methodologies used in their one-hour intro course for science students.

**3:15-3:30** Coffee break

**3:30-4:45** Session 2: RStudio Test Drive

Now it's your turn.  By the end of this session, each participant will have created a simple R Markdown (.Rmd) document in RStudio.


**4:45-5:45** Work time to identify a discipline-specific dataset or example question.

**6:00-7:00** Dinner at Prince Conference Center

**After** Pub nearby?

### Thursday, June 13, 2013

**8:30-10:00am**: Session 3: Relational Data

Participants will learn how to create new data sets from existing data sets by grouping, subsetting, and merging and to create graphical outputs  (e.g. scatterplots, maps, etc.) from the resulting data sets.

**10:00-10:30**: Coffee break

**10:30-Noon**: Session 4: *ibid*

**Noon-1:00** Lunch

**1:00-3:15**: Session 5: Slide Show

Each participant will present 1-3 slides using markdown that show an example of a data set or question of interest.

**3:15-3:30** Coffee break

**3:30-4:45**: Session 6: Birds of a Feather

This is chance to have follow-up discussions with people interested in similar aspects and/or applications of computation and visualization.  

**4:45-5:45**: Work time

Review and use RStudio to generate graphics or to work on getting data set of interest imported and/or analyzed.

**6:00-7:00** Dinner

**After** Pub nearby?

### Friday, June 14, 2013

**8:30-10:00am**: Session 7: Modeling techniques 

Topics will include notions of best fit, computational tools for computing best fit, confidence intervals for fitted parameters and trees/clustering

**10:00-10:30**: Coffee break

**10:30-Noon** Session 8: Work Time

Continue working with your data (small-group consulations available)

**Noon-1:00** lunch

**1:00-3:15**: Session 9: Planning for Next Steps

With others from your institution determine

 * tools/recources needed
 * other key players that will help ensure success
 * timeline for implementation
 * possible barriers/challenges for sustaining effort when return to own campus

**3:15-3:30** Coffee break

**3:30-4:30** wrap-up/depart

### Overview

#### Time Utilization
* About 50% of the time orienting participants to the DCF course
    * The topics and skills covered by it (data manipulation, visualization, and workflow)
    * Modifications
    * How to deploy it
* About 25% of the time discussing modules that participants would like to develop for their own courses
* About 25% starting to do development

#### Deliverables

Participants will generate
* 1-3 slides using markdown that show an example of a data set or question of interest.  To be presented during session 5 or 6 on Thursday.
* Graphical portrayals of data (their own or one in the DCF package)
* Clustering graphic
