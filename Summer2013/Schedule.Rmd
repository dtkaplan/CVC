**6:00-7:00** Dinner

**After** Pub nearby?

### Friday, June 14, 2013

**8:30-10:00am**: Session 7: Modeling techniques (best fit with confidence intervals) and trees/clustering

**10:30-Noon** Session 8: work with data set and or small-group consulations

**Noon-1:00** lunch

**1:00-3:15**: Session 9: develop concrete with those from your institution for next steps- timeline for implementation; discussion of possible barriers/challenges for sustaining effort when return to own campus?

### Overview

#### Time Utilization
* About 50% of the time orienting participants to the DCF course
    * The topics and skills covered by it (data manipulation, visualization, and workflow)
    * Modifications
    * How to deploy it
* About 25% of the time discussing modules that participants would like to develop for their own courses
* About 25% starting to do development

#### Deliverables

Participants will generate
* 1-3 slides using markdown that show an example of a data set or question of interest.  To be presented during session 5 or 6 on Thursday.
* Graphical portrayals of data (their own or one in the DCF package)
* Clustering graphic
