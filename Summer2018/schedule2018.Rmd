A. How to organize your data
    
  a. [**Introduction slides**](Learn/TidyData/tidy_data.html), but the basics are
    
      * Rectangular format: cases (rows) and variables (columns)
      * Separate your analysis from data storage.
      * Use a codebook to describe your cases and variables in detail.
      
  b. `tidyverse` provides a toolkit for getting data into
    this format.  (More later.)
    
B. Importing CSV and Excel files into RStudio
 
  * [Notes](Learn/ImportingData/ImportingData.html)
