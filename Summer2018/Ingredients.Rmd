## Ingredients for use in Data Science Recipes

There are lots of data science recipes, but many of them are created 
from a common set of ingredients.  We can spend more or less time on 
becoming familiar with these ingredients depending on

* The recipies you are interested in (emphasize most useful)
* The ingredients you are already feel comfortable with (avoid the most familiar)


## Graphics | Packages: `ggformula`, `mosaic`

Plots like this are simple to make in R:

```{r, fig.width = 10, out.width = "90%"}
gf_linerange(low_temp + high_temp ~ date, color = ~ avg_temp, data = Weather) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_colour_gradientn(colors = rev(rainbow(5)))) %>%
  gf_facet_grid(city ~ year, scales = "free_x")
```


## Graphics | Packages: `ggformula`, `mosaic`


```{r, fig.height = 6}
    require(RColorBrewer)
    require(ggformula)
    load("/Users/rpruim/projects/github/talks/LessVolume/Data/likertdata.Rdata")
    colors1 <- brewer.pal(5, "Spectral")
    colorsB <- colors1[c(2,3,4,5,1)]
    responses1 <- c("Not at all satisfied", "2", "3", "4", "Extremely satisfied")
    responses2 <- responses1[c(1,5,2,4,3)]
    gf_col(Freq ~ citystate, fill = ~ factor(Response, levels = responses2), data = trial2$neg) %>%
      gf_col(data = trial2$pos, fill = ~ factor(Response, levels = responses2)) %>%
      gf_facet_wrap( ~ year, nrow = 3) %>%
      gf_refine(
        scale_fill_manual(
          breaks = responses1,
          values = colorsB,
          name = "Response"),
        scale_y_continuous(
          limits=c(-0.5, 1),
          breaks=seq(from=-0.5, to=0.75, by=0.25),
          labels=c("50%", "25%", "0", "25%", "50%", "75%")
        ),
        coord_flip()
      ) %>%
      gf_labs(
        title = "Community satisfaction", x = "", y = "") %>%
      gf_theme(
        legend.text=element_text(size=10),
        legend.title=element_text(size=12),
        axis.text=element_text(size=6, angle = 30),
        strip.text=element_text(size=11))
```

## Tidy Data and Data Wrangling | Packages: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, etc.

Often we need to transform data into the proper format for analysis or graphics.

Tidy data: 

  * rows = observational units/cases/subjects
  * columns = variables
  * no exceptions, no "extras" (units, summaries, comments, meta-data, etc.)


## Data scraping | Packages: `rvest`

* Lots of data available online
* May require some work to put a in the proper format (wrangling)


## Importing your own data | Packages: `readr`, `googlesheets`, `readxl`, `haven`

R is capable of reading data in a wide variety of formats

* general-purpose formats: csv, tsv, fixed width

* data from other software: Excel, Google spreadsheets, SAS, SPSS

* databases: MySQL, MS SQLServer, etc.

* specialized data fromats: shape files for maps, FASTA files for genetics, etc.

If you have data you want to use in R, we can help you get it into R.


## Reporting | Packages: `rmarkdown`, `bookdown`, `blogdown`, `knitr`, `flexdashboard`, etc.

<table>
<tr style = "vertical-align:top">
<td width = "30%" valign = "top">
RStudio provides a rich set of authoring tools to produce static and dynamic documents
in a variety of formats (HTML, PDF, Word)

  * [RStudio quick tour](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html)
  * [flexdashboard examples](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/examples.html)
</td>
<td width = "70%" style="vertical-align:top">
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7f4541b4fee94579f02fc2d8bd3de0e09c010f4d/49281/images/quicktourexample.png")
```
</td>
</tr>
</table>


## Reporting | Packages: `rmarkdown`, `bookdown`, `blogdown`, `knitr`, `flexdashboard`, etc.

R code and output can be included as well.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  "https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dcf4c184fe1dde2460eeb16e6ae7566e1c0756c9/3605e/images/markdownchunk.png")
```


## Tutorials -- run R code in a webpage | Packages: `learnr`

* We will see several examples of this in the "Shop" part of the workshop.

* These are **not difficult to make** -- use the same system as report creation (Rmd).

## Websites | rstudio.cloud + GitHub

Websites can also be created using RMarkdown.

  * The website for this workshop was done in RMarkdown
  * These slides were, too.

GitHub can be used to host the website.

## GitHub

RStudio has excellent support for GitHub more generally.  Great for

* maintaining your own work
* student projects
* creating R packages and making them available to others


## Maps | Packages: `leaflet`

* More info from RStudio: [webinar](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/mapping-in-r-with-leaflet/),
[tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng = -92.7202, lat = 41.74844, label = "Welcome to Grinnell College")
```

## Maps | Packages: `ggformula`, `maps`, `sf`


```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
library(maps) 
library(mosaic) 
library(sf) 
require(purrr) 
  USshape <- 
    sf::st_as_sf(maps::map('state', plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE)) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(
      name_length = nchar(ID),
      centroid = purrr::map(geometry, st_centroid),
      coords_x = purrr::map_dbl(centroid, 1),
      coords_y = purrr::map_dbl(centroid, 2)
    ) 
    
  gf_sf(fill = ~ name_length, color = "white", data = USshape, alpha = 0.8,
        show.legend = FALSE) %>%
    # gf_sf(data = sf::st_centroid(USshape), color = "white", alpha = 0.5, size = 3) %>%
    # gf_text(coords_y ~ coords_x, label = ~ ID, color = "gray20", size = 2) %>%
    gf_labs(x = "", y = "") %>%
    gf_refine(mosaic::theme_map(), theme_bw()) %>%
    gf_labs(fill = "name length") %>% 
    gf_refine(
      scale_fill_gradientn(colors = rainbow(8)),
      guides(fill = FALSE))
```

## Apps -- interactivity, but no visible code | Packages: `shiny`, `shinydocs`

* These generally take a bit more work to program, but this is doable.

* Great for producing data explorations that don't require users to know any R.

* A few examples

    * [Nick Horton's SAT app](https://r.amherst.edu/apps/nhorton/sat)
    * [Randy's Confidence Interval app](http://rsconnect.calvin.edu/CIs/)
    * [StatPREP examples](https://statprep.github.io/Workshops_2018/LittleApps/little_apps.html)
    * [RStudio Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)

## "Advanced" R 

Don't let "advanced" scare you off.
They are things that many people don't get around to learning early on,
but they are not terribly difficult.

* Writing Functions

* [Creating Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)

* How the R language works (inspecting objects, avoiding inefficient "loops",
using C++ inside R, etc.)

* Hadley Wickham's [Advanced R (online) book](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)

## Modeling -- Don't forget Statistics! | Packages: many

R can fit an incredibly wide range of statistical models.

  * Linear regression (and generalizations)
  * Machine Learning
  * Simulation-based methods (Bootstrap, Randomization, Validation methods)
  * Bayesian methods
  * etc, etc, etc
