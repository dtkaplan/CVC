## Command chains

Your commands will be written as chains.  

* Each link in the chain will be a data verb and its arguments.
    - The very first link is usually a data frame.
    
* Links are connected by the chaining symbol `%>%`

* Often, but not always, you will save the output of the chain in a named object.
    - This is done with the *assignment operator*, `<-`
```
    Name_of_result <-     
      Starting_data_frame  %>%    
      first verb (arguments for details) %>%   
      next verb (and its arguments) %>%    
           ... and so on, up through ...   
      last verb (and its arguments)  
```

## An example command chain

```{r}
Princes <- 
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(grepl("Prince", name)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```

* A good idea to put each link on its own line
* Note that `%>%` is at the end of each line.
    - Except ... `Princes <-` is assignment
    - Except ... The last line has no `%>%`.
    
## Syntax and semantics

There are two distinct aspects involved in reading or writing a command chain.

1. Syntax: the grammar of the command
2. Semantics: the meaning of the command

The focus today is on syntax.

## Part of Speech

From the dictionarty 

> part of speech noun

> parts of speech a category to which a word is assigned in accordance with its syntactic functions. In English the main parts of speech are noun, pronoun, adjective, determiner, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.

## Parts of Speech in R

#. Data frames
#. Functions
#. Arguments
#. Variables
#. Constants
#. Assignment
#. Formulas (we won't use these until the end)

## Data frames

* A data frame comprises one or more variables. 
* Naming convention: data frames are given names that start with a CAPITAL LETTER, e.g., `RegisteredVoters`.
* A data frame will always be the input at the start of a command chain.
* If assignment is used to save the result, the object created is usually a data frame.

## Functions

* Functions are objects that transform an input into an output.
* Functions are always followed by parentheses, that is, an opening  `(` and, eventually, a closing `)`.
* Each link in a command chain starts with a function.
    - More specifically, the function is a *data verb* that takes a data frame as input and produces another data frame as output.
    - There are other kinds of functions, e.g. summary (or reduction) functions and transformation functions.

## Arguments

The things that go *inside* a function's parentheses are called *arguments*.  

* Arguments describe the details of what a function is to do. 
* If there are multiple arguments, they are always separated by commas.
* Many functions take *named arguments* which look like a name followed by an `=` sign, e.g. 
```r
summarise(total = sum(count))
```

You can also consider the data frame passed along by `%>%` as an argument to the following function.

## Variables

Variables are the components of data frames.

* When they are used, they *always* appear in function arguments, that is, between the function's parentheses.
* A good convention is for variables to have names that start with a lower-case letter.  The convention is *not* universally followed.
* Variables will *never* be followed by `(`.

## Constants

Constants are single values, most commonly a number or a character string. 

* Character strings will always be in quotation marks,     
   `"like this."`  
* Numerals are the written form of numbers, for instance.    
    `-42` 
    `1984` 
    `3.14159` 

## Discussion Problem

Consider this command chain:
```{r eval=FALSE}
Princes <- 
  BabyNames %>%
  filter(grepl("Prince", name)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(count))
```

Just from the syntax, you should be able to tell which of the five different kinds of object each of these things is: `Princes`, `BabyNames`, `filter`, `grepl`, `"Prince"`, `name`, `group_by`, `year`, `summarise`, `total`, `sum`, `count`.

Explain your reasoning.
