## Summer Workshop for Science^[We construe "science" broadly to include the natural and social sciences, as well as statistics, mathematics, and computer science. If you teach and want to integrate the use of data into your classes, this workshop is for you!] Faculty and Instructors 

### Working Schedule

A working schedule will be maintained [here](schedule2017.html) during
the workshop.  This will include links to presentations and resources
from the workshop.


### Feedback and Questions

We have created a [Feedback and Questions google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtoWauyDoBsHJd7yywkJNgiNaAXPiBjNhqO9Yw72jys/edit?usp=sharing) with questions (and answers) about the workshop.

### June 12-16, 2017 

The **first half** of the workshop starts at **9 am on June 12**. This portion
of the workshop aims to introduce faculty members to the open source software
package, RStudio. These days will serve as an introduction to using R for
handling data and graphics and include

*  An introduction to the RStudio environment
*  A "Doing More with Less Cookbook" for R
*  Designing and creating sophisticated graphical data visualizations
*  Data wrangling: Manipulating data for graphics and insight
*  Preparing documents that include text, static and dynamic graphics, and analysis

The **second half** of the workshop begins at noon on June 22. 
During this time participants will dig in on their own projects -- 
the "work" part of the workshop. Time will be spent:

*  Expanding elements of first half of workshop
*  Planning a case study
*  Development of case studies (individually or in small groups)

In order to support project development, participants will learn specific skills as needed including topics such as:

*  Summarizing data with models
    * how to construct plausible models and fit them
    * displaying models on graphics
    * displaying inferential ideas on graphs
*  Basic data scraping skills (how to get data from web sites)
*  Connecting to and working with large databases in R
*  More advanced data cleaning skills
*  Additional programming skills
*  resampling and bootstrap methods

All aspects of the workshop will be "hands on."  The workshop leaders include
several nationally recognized educators in data, graphics, and statistics.  You
provide the subject-matter expertise, we'll help you exploit the power of modern
compuation.

## In your classes ...

A major purpose of the second half of the workshop is to provide advice and help
in setting up a data visualization/computing project for you to use in your own
classes.  The tools you will learn are powerful enough that you will be able to
create a substantial project *during* the workshop, and will need just a few
hours to tune it up when you get home.
