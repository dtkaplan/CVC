```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
library(mdsr)   # Load additional packages here 
library(tidyr)
library(tm)
library(wordcloud)


# Some customization.  You can alter or delete as desired (if you know what you are doing).
trellis.par.set(theme=theme.mosaic()) # change default color scheme for lattice
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
```

This example is taken from the text mining chapter in http://mdsr-book.github.io/

and the tm package: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html

The *text analytics with r for students of literature book* may be a helpful resource http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319031637

In retrospective, the tidytext package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html) might have been a better approach to use (see http://tidytextmining.com/ for their companion book)
```{r}
data(Macbeth_raw)
# strsplit returns a list: we only want the first element
macbeth <- strsplit(Macbeth_raw, "\r\n")[[1]]
length(macbeth)
head(macbeth)
```

```{r}
macbeth[300:310]
```

The  `grep()` function works using a *needle* in a *haystack* paradigm, wherein the first argument is the regular expression (or pattern) you want to find (i.e., the needle) and the second argument is the character vector in which you want to find patterns (i.e., the haystack). Note that unless the argument value is set to TRUE, `grep()` returns the *indices* of the haystack in which the needles were found.

```{r}
macbeth_lines <- grep("  MACBETH", macbeth, value = TRUE)
length(macbeth_lines)
head(macbeth_lines)
```

```{r}
length(grep("  MACDUFF", macbeth))
```

The `grepl` function uses the same syntax but returns a logical vector as long as the haystack. Thus, while the length of the vector returned by `grep` is the number of matches, the length of the vector returned by `grepl` is always the same as the length of the haystack vector.

```{r}
length(grep("  MACBETH", macbeth))
length(grepl("  MACBETH", macbeth))
```

However, both will subset the original vector in the same way, and thus in this respect they are functionally equivalent.

```{r}
identical(macbeth[grep("  MACBETH", macbeth)],
          macbeth[grepl("  MACBETH", macbeth)])
```

To extract the piece of each matching line that actually matched, use the `str_extract()` function from the `stringr` package.

```{r}
library(stringr)
pattern <- "  MACBETH"
grep(pattern, macbeth, value = TRUE) %>%
  str_extract(pattern) %>%
  head()
```

```{r}
head(grep("MAC.", macbeth, value = TRUE))
head(grep("MACBETH\\.", macbeth, value = TRUE))
head(grep("MAC[B-Z]", macbeth, value = TRUE))
head(grep("MAC(B|D)", macbeth, value = TRUE))
head(grep("^  MAC[B-Z]", macbeth, value = TRUE))
head(grep("^ ?MAC[B-Z]", macbeth, value = TRUE))
head(grep("^ *MAC[B-Z]", macbeth, value = TRUE))
head(grep("^ +MAC[B-Z]", macbeth, value = TRUE))
```

We might learn something about the play by knowing when each character speaks as a function of the line number in the play. We can retrieve this information using `grepl()`.

```{r}
Macbeth <- grepl("  MACBETH\\.", macbeth)
LadyMacbeth <- grepl("  LADY MACBETH\\.", macbeth)
Banquo <- grepl("  BANQUO\\.", macbeth)
Duncan <- grepl("  DUNCAN\\.", macbeth)

speaker_freq <- data.frame(Macbeth, LadyMacbeth, Banquo, Duncan) %>%
  mutate(line = 1:length(macbeth)) %>%
  gather(key = "character", value = "speak", -line) %>%
  mutate(speak = as.numeric(speak)) %>%
  filter(line > 218 & line < 3172)
glimpse(speaker_freq)
```

Before we create the plot, we will gather some helpful contextual information about when each Act begins.

```{r}
acts_idx <- grep("^ACT [I|V]+", macbeth)
acts_labels <- str_extract(macbeth[acts_idx], "^ACT [I|V]+")
acts <- data.frame(line = acts_idx, labels = acts_labels)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = speaker_freq, aes(x = line, y = speak)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = character), method = "loess", se = 0, span = 0.4) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = acts_idx, color = "darkgray", lty = 3) +
  geom_text(data = acts, aes(y = 0.085, label = labels),
            hjust = "left", color = "darkgray") +
  ylim(c(0, NA)) + xlab("Line Number") + ylab("Proportion of Speeches")
```

### Some word analyses

```{r}
Corpus <- VCorpus(VectorSource(macbeth))
sampleline <- 300
Corpus[[sampleline]] %>%
  as.character() %>%
  strwrap()
```
```{r}
Corpus <- Corpus %>%
  tm_map(stripWhitespace) %>%
  tm_map(removeNumbers) %>%
  tm_map(removePunctuation) %>%
  tm_map(content_transformer(tolower)) %>%
  tm_map(removeWords, stopwords("english"))
strwrap(as.character(Corpus[[sampleline]]))
```

```{r}
wordcloud(Corpus, max.words = 30, scale = c(8, 1),
          colors = topo.colors(n = 30), random.color = TRUE)
```
```{r}
DTM <- DocumentTermMatrix(Corpus, control = list(weighting = weightTfIdf))
# DTM
findFreqTerms(DTM, lowfreq = 0.8)
DTM %>% as.matrix() %>%
  apply(MARGIN = 2, sum) %>%
  sort(decreasing = TRUE) %>%
  head(9)
```
