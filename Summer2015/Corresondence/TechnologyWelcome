CVC Participants,

The 2015 CVC workshop is now less than two weeks away. We're looking forward to meeting you all at Smith College on Monday, July 13 at 9 am.

If you were expecting things to begin at noon, we opplogize for the confusion.  Somehow we had noon on some documents and 9 am on others.  But we do plan to begin at 9. If your schedule doesn't allow you to join us until later in the morning, come as soon as you are able and we'll get you up to speed.

Some of you have asked questions about preparing for the workshop and/or logistics details.  To answer these questions, we have created a google doc that we will continue to use for feeback and questions before and during the workshop.  A link to the document can be found at

Feel free to add to the document at any time.  For now you will find some imporant information there including

  * Details about what to do if you arrive from out of town on Sunday.
  * Details about the location of our session on Monday.
  * Things you can do to prepare for the workshop.
  
While advance preparation is not required, we would like you to check that you have access to the RStudio server at http://rstudio.calvin.edu:8787.  You should be able to login using the google email address you provided us.  If that works, you are good to go.  If you are unable to login, contact Randy Pruim (rpruim@gmail.com) and we'll see if we can get things sorted.

See you all soon.
