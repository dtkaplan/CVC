## Working Schedule

This scheule will be updated throughout the workshop.  All items should be 
considered tentative until they happen since we will adjust things to 
meet the needs and wishes of the participants.

Arrival day for many coming from out of town.  

### Monday

 1. Welcome
    a. Welcome to CVC [Ben Baumer]
    b. [Goals and outline for the week](Slides/IntroOverview.html) [Randy]

 2. Introductions [Randy]
    a. **Activity**: Split up into groups of three or four and introduce yourselves. For each person, another person should write a short bio (or other introductory information).  Use this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zt5AYH7HsXTbIl5d6gjn0E_-e5m59IBmIo0jrIkLXsI/edit?usp=sharing). 

 3. A First Case Study [Danny]

  * [Slides](http://dtkaplan.github.io/CVC/Summer2014/Notes/MedicareSpending/PriceOfHealth.html)

 4. RStudio orientation 
    
 5. Introduction to R
  * [Less Volume, More Creativity -- An R Quick Start](Slides/LessVolume.html) [Randy]
  * Getting your own data into R [Randy]
  * **Activity**: Create a plot using data that you have imported into R.

 6. [RMarkdown](http://prezi.com/e7wtfnacj9ub/) [Nick]
    a. Creating PDF/HTML/Word documents in RStudio
    b. [TISE paper by Baumer *et al*](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/90b2f5xh)
    c. **Activity**: Write and publish a description of some 
    straightforward, data-oriented topic you'd like to present in class. 
        * Include at least 1 plot (even if unrelated) to make sure 
        you know how to do that.  
    
 7. How to organize your data
    a. Rectangular format: cases (rows) and variables (columns)
       * not the only format -- especially these days
       * very useful format for structured data and for plotting
       * best to master rectangular data before moving on to other things
       
    b. Separate analysis from data storage.
       * don't forget a codebook that describes your cases and variables in detail
       
    c. **Activity**: The spreadsheet [here](http://vote.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@clerk/documents/webcontent/wcms1p-126724.xlsx) contains data on the Minneapolis 2013 election by ward and precinct.  Identify the elements of this spreadsheet that are not in standard rectangular data format.
    
    d. **Activity**: Enter data [in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am13enSalO74dFRFZHNlaVE3NjZfUjBQOUNoMmRlUWc&usp=sharing)
    indicating types of data you are interested in.
